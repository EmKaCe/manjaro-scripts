# Manjaro-Scripts for GNOME

This is just a post-install script for my manjaro gnome.
I use Manjaro GNOME minimal and simply run this script.

The installation is somewhat automated and is only supposed to save time for me.

### `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmKaCe/manjaro-scripts/master/automated.sh | bash`
